# Letter to A*

Convert US Letter PDFs to A3, A4, A5, etc.

This project is a very simple shell script to convert U.S. Letter PDF pages into A4 pages (and also any other "A" size), and then collate them into one combined PDF document.

Specifically, this works on the excellent [Mag-7 Star Atlas Project][mag7]. It is a very handy, twenty-page star atlas, if in an inconvenient paper size. So this script converts that to A4; and since we've already done that, we may as well generate A3 as an easy-to-see double-size format, as well as A5 as an easy-to-store half-size format.
