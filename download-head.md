# Mag-7 Star Atlas Project (in A4)

*"An elegant star atlas, for a more civilized age."*

Here, you will find the Mag-7 Star Atlas, fit to A3 (large), A4 (standard), and A3 (small) sized paper.

## How to find the files you need.

There are many variations of the star atlas. So, to figure out what you need, you need to answer three questiosn:

1. Do I want the small, normal, or large version (half-size, normal size, double size respectively)?
2. Do I want black-and-white or color?
3. Do I want to download individual pages, or all twenty pages in one PDF file?

With these in mind, you should be able to scroll down and find what you need.
